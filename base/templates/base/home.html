                <h4>My First Job as a Developer</h4>
            <hr>
            <p>I was working as a intern for a company and I was working on Django framework there. I also worked 
            on React.js framework. And gradually I was fascinated with Python and Django.</p>

            <p>Now here I am, Creating my own resume profile using Django Frmaework. </p>

            <p>This project has led to me to deeper understanding of Django framework and I am looking forward
            to learn more about this framework.</p>
